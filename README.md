# IntelliJack: AI Oracle Service on Fhenix

IntelliJack is an AI oracle service built on Fhenix, providing inference over private data with on-chain outcomes. This innovative project combines the power of AI with blockchain technology, offering a unique solution for developers seeking to integrate advanced AI functionalities into their decentralized applications.

## üìö Background & Story

IntelliJack began its journey on Galadriel's devnet, which was originally conceived as an "L1 for AI". However, when Galadriel pivoted and deprecated their AI oracle service, I realized I needed to develop my own AI oracle sollution to ensure continuity and expand its capabilities.

To preserve the functionality of existing dApps and unlock new possibilities, IntelliJack reimagined an oracle service to be built on Lit Protocol. This strategic shift enables the service to operate on any EVM chain, significantly broadening its applicability and reach.

The migration to Fhenix  not only maintained the project's core functionalitiess but also introduced groundbreaking features, particularly in handling private data for AI inference. 

A key innovation in this iteration is the introduction of an agent struct within the oracle contract. This addition facilitates functionality similar to OpenAI's GPTs, opening up new avenues for AI-driven decentralized applications.

To showcase the potential of this system, we've developed a basic Agent marketplace. Here, users can create agents and modify them with secret attributes, simulating a dynamic economy of AI entities.

Furthermore, we've created a smart contract for Story Protocol that demonstrates how this AI-driven economy could function in practice. This integration illustrates the potential for narrative-driven, AI-powered experiences in the blockchain space.

## üåü Features

- AI inference over private data
- On-chain outcomes
- Agent marketplace for creating and modifying AI agents
- Integration with Story Protocol for simulating AI economy
- Cross-chain compatibility (previously Galadriel, now on any EVM chain via Lit Protocol)
